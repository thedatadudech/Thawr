# CLAUDE.md — working agreement for Claude Code sessions on Thawr

Thawr is a self-hosted, WireGuard-based private network (mesh VPN / ZTNA).
One binary. No cloud. Works offline. Language: Go. License: Apache-2.0.

Read this file first in every session. Then read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
and the one spec in `docs/specs/` the session is about. Do not read all
specs; only the one you implement plus any it references.

## Session protocol

1. One spec per session. The session prompt names it
   (`Implement docs/specs/NNN-name.md. Plan first.`).
2. Use plan mode. Present the plan, wait for approval, then implement.
3. Run `make test lint` before every commit. Both must be clean.
4. Commit with a semantic message (see below). One logical change per
   commit; a spec may take several commits.
5. Mark the spec done in `TASKS.md` and add one line per non-obvious
   decision under that spec's entry (these are the session notes).
6. Do not start the next spec. Do not refactor code the spec does not touch.
7. Ask before deviating from any ADR in `docs/adr/` or any fixed decision
   in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. If a spec contradicts an ADR, stop and ask.
8. Never commit debug code, `fmt.Println` debugging, or commented-out code.

## Commands

```
make build         # go build -o bin/thawr ./cmd/thawr
make test          # go test -race -count=1 ./...
make lint          # gofmt -l . ; go vet ./... ; golangci-lint run
make run-server    # go run ./cmd/thawr server --config config/server.example.yaml
make run-client    # go run ./cmd/thawr client up --server https://127.0.0.1:8443 --token $THAWR_TOKEN
                   # (enrols when needed, then runs the sync daemon; client status|ping|down|rotate-key talk to its socket)
make integration   # go test -race -tags integration ./tests/... (Linux, needs CAP_NET_ADMIN)
make proto         # regenerate gRPC/protobuf code (buf + plugins via go run, nothing to install)
```

Single package: `go test -race -run TestName ./internal/control/...`.
Toolchain: Go 1.26 or newer; `go.mod` pins the minimum. No CGO anywhere
(`CGO_ENABLED=0` must build the whole binary).

## Repository layout

```
cmd/thawr/          entry point, subcommands server | client | admin
internal/control/   peer registry, keys, enrollment, policy engine, netmap; path/ = candidate order + path state machine
internal/stun/      STUN codec (copied from Tailscale), client discovery, rate-limited server
internal/relay/     relay server and client-side relay proxy
internal/wg/        WireGuard adapter: kernel (wgctrl) and wireguard-go
internal/store/     SQLite persistence and embedded SQL migrations
internal/api/       gRPC (client<->server) and REST (admin UI) handlers
internal/config/    YAML loading, validation, defaults
internal/client/    device side: state dir, TLS pinning, enrollment, sync daemon, local socket API
internal/server/    composes the server: bootstrap order, readiness, reload, shutdown
web/                admin UI: plain HTML/JS, embedded via embed.FS
docs/               vision, architecture, ADRs, threat model, specs
tests/              integration tests (netns-based)
config/             example configs
```

## Fixed architecture decisions

Full detail and rationale in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/adr/`.
These are not up for discussion inside an implementation session.

- Single binary `thawr` with subcommands `server`, `client`, `admin`
  (ADR 0005).
- Data plane is WireGuard only: kernel module via `wgctrl` where present,
  otherwise `wireguard-go`. No other tunnel protocol (ADR 0004).
- NAT traversal: STUN (built into the server) plus UDP hole punching via
  WireGuard handshakes; DERP-style relay built into the server binary as
  fallback. The relay forwards opaque WireGuard packets and never holds
  session keys.
- Control plane: gRPC between client and server, REST plus embedded HTML
  admin UI, all on one TLS listener. Admin CLI talks to the server over a
  local Unix socket (Windows: named pipe).
- Store: SQLite via `modernc.org/sqlite`, pure Go (ADR 0002). Migrations
  are numbered SQL files embedded in `internal/store`.
- Config: one YAML file. A server starts with `public_addr` alone; every
  other key has a default.
- Policy: YAML ACL file owned by the user (typically in their git repo).
  Default deny. Enforced by key distribution (visibility) and on the
  receiving peer (port filter).
- Identity: local users plus one-time enrollment tokens. OIDC is optional
  and pluggable, never required (ADR 0006).
- Every peer is a generic identity with `kind` in {human, server, agent}.
  Nothing may assume a peer is a person.
- Logging: `log/slog`, structured, key=value. Never log keys, tokens,
  secrets, or password hashes; log key fingerprints (first 8 hex chars of
  SHA-256) instead.

## Rules

1. Never implement cryptography. Use WireGuard for the tunnel, `crypto/*`
   and `golang.org/x/crypto` for hashing and password storage,
   `crypto/rand` for randomness. No hand-rolled key exchange, no custom
   framing that carries plaintext secrets.
2. Never log or print a private key, node secret, enrollment token secret,
   or password. Tests must not contain real keys either; generate them.
3. Zero hardcoded secrets. Secrets come from env vars or files with mode
   0600. Config values that are secrets accept `_file` variants.
4. Validate at every boundary: config on load, every gRPC/REST request,
   every token, every policy file. Reject, do not sanitize silently.
5. Errors are wrapped with `fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)` and carry context
   (peer id, token id, file path). No blanket `recover`. No `panic` outside
   `main` and programmer-error guards.
6. Dependencies are injected through constructors (`New...(deps)`).
   No package-level mutable state, no `init()` that does work.
7. Exported identifiers have doc comments. Inline comments only where the
   logic is non-obvious. TODOs are written `TODO(YYYY-MM-DD): text`.
8. Unit tests for all control-plane logic (`internal/control`,
   `internal/store`, `internal/config`, `internal/api`). Table-driven
   where natural. Store tests open a SQLite file in `t.TempDir()`; the
   shared-cache in-memory DSN misbehaves under `database/sql` pooling.
9. Platform-specific code lives in `_linux.go`, `_darwin.go`,
   `_windows.go` files with a shared interface; the rest of the tree must
   compile and test on all three.
10. Adding a dependency requires: permissive license (Apache-2.0, MIT,
    BSD), pure Go, and a line in the dependency table in
    `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
11. Semantic commits only: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`,
    `chore:`, `test:`. Scope in parentheses when useful:
    `feat(control): one-time enrollment tokens`.

## Code style

- `gofmt` and `goimports` formatting. `golangci-lint` config in
  `.golangci.yml` is the source of truth for enabled linters.
- Context first parameter on anything that does I/O.
- Interfaces are defined where they are consumed, kept small.
- Time is injected (`func() time.Time`) wherever expiry is checked, so
  tests do not sleep.
